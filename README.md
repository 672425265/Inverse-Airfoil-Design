# Inverse-Airfoil-Design  
Project on Inverse Airfoil Design  
Initial Airfoil which is to be modified is NACA0009 and target airfoil to be achieved is NACA6409.   
C*p* of the airfoils is plotted using [XFOIL](http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/) Software by Mark Drela MIT.  
Project is Under [Prof. A M Pradeep](https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/~ampradeep/), [Aeropsace Dept.](https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/) [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/)
